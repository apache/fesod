## Enable 2FA on GitHub

Two-factor authentication (2FA) refers to the authentication method that combines both passport, and an object (credit card, SMS phone, token or biomarkers as fingerprint) to identify a user.
To ensure the security of the committerâ€™s account, we need you to enable 2FA to sign in and contribute codes on GitHub.

More details, please refer to [2FA](https://help.github.com/articles/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization/).

For detailed operations, please refer to [Enable Two Factor Authentication with TOTP](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-a-totp-mobile-app/).

After enabling 2FA, you need to sign in GitHub with the way of username/password + mobile phone authentication code.
