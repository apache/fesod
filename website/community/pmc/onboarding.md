This document primarily serves as a guide for new PPMC members to Apache Fesod (Incubating).

Upon receiving an invitation email from Apache Fesod (Incubating) PPMC, a new PPMC member should consider whether accepting.
If they decide in favor, they should select **"Reply All"** and express their decision.

## Subscribe to Private Mailing List

- Send email to [private-subscribe@fesod.apache.org](mailto:private-subscribe@fesod.apache.org)
- You will receive an email with the subject `confirm subscribe to private@fesod.apache.org`
- Reply to the email with "Confirm" in the body

If you receive an email with the subject `WELCOME to private@fesod.apache.org`, you have successfully subscribed to the private mailing list.

It's required for PPMC members to subscribe the private mailing list. The private list is only for confidential discussions that should not be made public, such as the suitability of a particular individual to become a committer or a member of the PPMC.

### Don’t mix private and public lists in posts

- Don’t post to both the dev and private lists. Each member of the PPMC should be on the dev list, so posting to dev is sufficient.
- Likewise, don’t post to both the Incubator general and Incubator private lists. Each member of the IPMC is on the Incubator general list, so posting to the general list is sufficient.

## Read PPMC Member Guide
