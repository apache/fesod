Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p><p>Copyright Â© 2025 The Apache Software Foundation, Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.</p><p>Apache, the names of Apache projects, and the feather logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation in the United States and/or other countries.
